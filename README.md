# MTFPlus
* A plugin to enhace getting to play as MTF Cadet, currently the most interesting class in the game and not unfun to play at all. Actually way better than zombie, but I'm not gonna rant about it, who reads these lmao

# Usage

Place your classes in a .txt file (A MUST) into your AppData folder (windows), .config folder (Linux) or in a per-server basis (that is, in your server folder) if you're using the non-global config, if you're using the global one then the files will go in the same folder as MultiAdmin.exe

## Making a new class

Before anything else, Items and Roles are in the following link, they may be confusing without understanding what they are or where they come from: https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/wiki/Enum-Lists

This is the template file. This one will be autogenerated first time you boot up the server.

`medic.txt`
```yaml
Inventory: SENIOR_GUARD_KEYCARD, P90, RADIO, DISARMER, MEDKIT, MEDKIT, MEDKIT, MEDKIT
Max: 2
Role: NTF_CADET
Probability: 80
Ammo5: 200
Ammo7: 70
Ammo9: 50
```
Those are all the available options. Below is a table with all the options that let you configure by default some fields you might not use for some classes. If some class is missing, for example, "Ammo5", it will use the default value listed below or one you might configure (as always, in config_gameplay.txt)

# Configs / Default values
The only config, currently, is `mtfp_enable`. Works as advertised.

## Default values
| Key | Default value | Definition |
|:-----------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:
| Inventory | `default_item_cadet` config from Smod2 | The items the guy will respawn with. Used as in Smod2 |
| Max | 1 | The maximum amount of players that can respawn as this class |
| Role | NTF_CADET | The role they will be after respawning. Yes, you can randomly respawn a peanut. |
| Probability | 100 | Works as a percentage. This is NOT the chance of one player to spawn as the class, this is the chance for the class to be spawned (and the player is randomly picked). So if it's too low, it will probably not respawn. |
| Ammo5/Ammo7/Ammo9 | Default ones that probably come from storm37k's Default Ammo plugin | Ammo5 is only used by the MTF E-11 Rifle. MP7 and Logicer use Ammo7.  COM15, P90 and USP use Ammo9. |
